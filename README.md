### **📌 Rule-Based Chatbot Project in Python (Using `nltk`)**  

This chatbot is a **rule-based chatbot**, meaning it relies on predefined patterns and responses instead of AI or machine learning. It uses **regular expressions** to match user input and respond accordingly.  

---

## **📂 Project Structure (How Many Files to Create in PyCharm)**
You should create **two files** inside your PyCharm project:  

1️⃣ **`main.py`** → Runs the chatbot and starts the conversation.  
2️⃣ **`chatbot.py`** → Contains chatbot logic (patterns, responses, and chatbot functionality).  

---

## **🛠️ Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**

### **1️⃣ Import Required Libraries**
At the top of `chatbot.py`, we import necessary modules from `nltk`:  
```python
from nltk.chat.util import Chat, reflections
```
- `Chat`: Provides chatbot logic by matching user input with predefined patterns.  
- `reflections`: A dictionary that maps pronouns (`"I am"` → `"you are"`) to make responses more natural.  

---

### **2️⃣ Define Chatbot Responses**
We create a list of **"patterns"** (regular expressions) and their corresponding responses:  

```python
pairs = [
    [
        r"(.*)my name is (.*)",  
        ["Hello %2, How are you today?"]
    ],
    [
        r"(.*)help(.*)",  
        ["I can help you! What do you need?"]
    ],
    [
        r"(.*)your name ?",  
        ["My name is Chatbot. I'm here to assist you!"]
    ],
    [
        r"how are you (.*) ?",  
        ["I'm doing great!", "I am fine! How can I help you?"]
    ],
    [
        r"quit",  
        ["Bye for now. See you soon!", "It was nice talking to you!"]
    ],
    [
        r"(.*)",  
        ["That's interesting! Tell me more."]
    ],
]
```

### **📝 Explanation of Pairs**
Each pattern follows this structure:
```python
[
    r"pattern",  
    ["response1", "response2"]
]
```
- The **first element** is a **regular expression** (regex) to match user input.  
- The **second element** is a **list of possible responses**.  

Example:
- User: `"my name is John"`  
- Pattern: `"(.*)my name is (.*)"`  
- Response: `"Hello John, How are you today?"`  

---

### **3️⃣ Define Reflections**
Reflections help make the chatbot's responses more natural by mapping words:
```python
print(reflections)
```
**Example:**
```python
{
    "i am": "you are",
    "i was": "you were",
    "i": "you",
    "i'm": "you are",
    "my": "your",
    "you": "me",
    "me": "you"
}
```
- User: `"I am happy"`  
- Response: `"You are happy"`  

---

### **4️⃣ Create and Start the Chatbot**
```python
print("Hi, I'm Chatbot! Type in English to start a conversation. Type 'quit' to exit.")
chat = Chat(pairs, reflections)  # Create chatbot
chat.converse()  # Start chatbot
```
- This initializes the chatbot and starts the conversation.  
- The chatbot will keep running until the user types `"quit"`.  

---

## **📌 Running the Project**
### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
If you haven't already installed `nltk`, run:
```bash
pip install nltk
```

### **Step 2: Run the Chatbot**
1. Open **PyCharm Terminal**  
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/chatbot_project
   ```
3. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Start chatting with your bot!

---

## **💡 Example Chat Session**
```
Hi, I'm Chatbot! Type in English to start a conversation. Type 'quit' to exit.
> hi
Hello!
> my name is Alex
Hello Alex, How are you today?
> how are you?
I'm doing great!
> tell me something
That's interesting! Tell me more.
> quit
Bye for now. See you soon!
```
